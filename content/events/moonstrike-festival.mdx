## Checklist
- Clear the daily bounties before reset to maximize lantern currency
- Run festival expedition twice per day for bonus shells
- Coordinate with guildmates on boss share missions to hit the 3x multiplier quickly

### Tips
1. Save lantern currency until day 4 to see the final reward rotation.
2. Use Rowan + Maloch sustain squads on the co-op boss to avoid wipe penalties.
3. Enable push notifications in-game; refresh timers align with server midnight.
