## Strengths
- Double-cast ultimate melts shield-heavy squads
- Passive stun softens melee dives
- Thrives in Dream Realm boss rotations that spawn adds

## Weaknesses
- Needs protection from ranged assassins
- Falls off in single-target fights without proper glyph allocation

## Notes
- Pair with Thesku for armor shred and consistent grouping
- Use in Coliseum defense to punish teleport teams
- Prioritize Haste › Crit Damage › Attack glyphs
