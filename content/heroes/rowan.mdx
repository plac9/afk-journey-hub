## Strengths
- Energy batteries keep hyper carries online
- Burst healing and shields smooth incoming spikes
- Shops instantly refill Dream Realm pushes when timed with rage windows

## Weaknesses
- Needs frontline peel; dives or silence chains shut him down
- Skill queueing matters—mistimed potion drops waste energy

## Notes
1. Pair with Shemira/Thoran to accelerate ramping ultimates.
2. For Dream Realm Merchant, delay potion drops until boss marks targets.
3. Swap his exclusive furniture to +30 before Abyssal Expedition tiles for stronger shield pulses.
